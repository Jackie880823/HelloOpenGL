# Building an OpenGL ES Environment
---
In order to draw graphics with OpenGL ES in your Android application, you 
must create a view container for them. One of the more straight-forward 
ways to do this is to implement both a GLSurfaceView and a GLSurfaceView.
Renderer. A GLSurfaceView is a view container for graphics drawn with 
OpenGL and GLSurfaceView.Renderer controls what is drawn within that view. 
For more information about these classes, see the OpenGL ES developer guide.
